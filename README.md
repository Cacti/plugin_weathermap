# Cacti-Based PHP Network Weathermap 0.98a

This is the thurban fork of PHP Network Weathermap, version 0.98a originally
created by Howard Jones (howie@thingy.com) who granted us the rights to include
this as part of the core plugins under The Cacti Group's repositories.

See the docs sub-directory for full HTML documentation, FAQ and example config.

See CHANGES for the most recent updates, listed by version.

See COPYING for the license under which php-weathermap is released.

## Compability
This version only works with Cacti 1.x onwards.  A re-write of the user interface
is being made to make it more compatible with 1.2.x and 1.3.x releases.

## Contribute

Check out the main [Cacti](http://www.cacti.net) web site for downloads, change
logs, release notes and more!

### Community forums

Given the large scope of Cacti, the forums tend to generate a respectable amount
of traffic. Doing your part in answering basic questions goes a long way since
we cannot be everywhere at once. Contribute to the Cacti community by
participating on the [Cacti Community Forums](http://forums.cacti.net).

For Network Weathermap's core support, there is much more information along with
tutorials and updates available at Howard Jone's site:
