# PHP Network Weathermap 1.0

This is PHP Network Weathermap fork, version 1.0.  The PHP Weathermap was
originally by Howard Jones (howie@thingy.com).  As Howie has scaled back his
Cacti plugin development work, we will release this version that incorporates
his core framework from the 0.98 version.  In future releases, we will look
to incorporate subequent releases of the WeatherMap core.

See the docs sub-directory for full HTML documentation, FAQ and example config.

See CHANGELOG.md for the most recent updates, listed by version.

See COPYING for the license under which php-weathermap is released.

## Compatibility

This version only works with Cacti 1.2.x onwards.  A re-write of the user interface
is being made to make it more compatible with 1.2.x and 1.3.x releases.

logs, release notes and more!

## Community forums

Given the large scope of Cacti, the forums tend to generate a respectable amount
of traffic. Doing your part in answering basic questions goes a long way since
we cannot be everywhere at once. Contribute to the Cacti community by
participating on the [Cacti Community Forums](http://forums.cacti.net).

For Network Weathermap's core support, there is much more information along with
tutorials and updates available at Howard Jone's site:

## Important Notes

This version of Weathermap only works with Cacti 1.2.x and above only.
beta, yet non-production use at this time.

The location of backgrounds and object images has changed!  The upgrade script 
will attempt to move these backgrounds and images to the new locations, 
but you may have some cleanup to do especially if you customized the locations.

WARNING: Before upgrading make ensure the poller account can move config file
images into into the plugins various images directories.  Fail to do so 
may result in corrupted config files.

NOTE: The directories: `cacti-resources` and `editor-resources` have been removed
in favor of the standard `js` and `css` folders.  You should remove these
folders after installation.

WARNING: Since previously the WeatherMap Editor had essentially no security, 
this version will be 100% dependent on the Cacti Security model to authorize users.

NOTE: The Overlib library dependency has been removed in this release.

When reviewing the plugin in detail, there were so many possible enhancements
that could be incorporated into the tool, but for now, it's really just to
bring the Weathermap plugin fully into the Cacti 1.x and beyond.
